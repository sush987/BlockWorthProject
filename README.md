What issues it solves

We got this idea of creating a defi solution to the Cibil score and loan transactions after coming across an article where hackers leaked loan information of thousands of people. (src: https://inc42.com/buzz/data-of-20-lakh-credit-score-records-leaked-from-chqbook/).  We then also thought that there should be a  solution to the frauds that happen around loans and credit like the rich manipulating the banks for loans and then not replaying them back, and millions of Non-performing loans which are a huge burden for the banking sector.  An application which stores the cibil scores of people along with their addresses smiliar to how we get balance of an address on Ethereum using the "address.balance" we should be able to get the cibil score of someone using a similar function. Every transaction made by an entity will be used to recalculate the cibil score after the transaction is finished. For any loan request or credit card issuing request, the bank or any other entity can check the cibil score and have confidence that this cibil score is securely calculated and is not fraudulent.
